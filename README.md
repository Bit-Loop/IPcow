## 🚀 Installation

To get started with IPCow, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipcow.git
cd ipcow
cargo build --release
```

## ⚙️ Usage

Run the IPCow server with:

```bash
cargo run
```

### Configuration Example:

During startup, configure ports and addresses interactively:

1. **Thread Multiplier**:  
   Define the multiplier for system threads to maximize concurrency (e.g., `2`).

2. **IP Addresses**:  
   Specify IPs for monitoring, including ranges:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 or 127.x.x.x or 127.0.0.1-127.252.255.255
   ```

3. **Ports**:  
   Enter individual ports or ranges for multi-port listening:
   ```
   8000-8010
   ```

### Output:
- Logs detected services, traffic patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.
- Supports exporting logs for integration with external tools.

## 📊 Performance

IPCow is optimized for scenarios requiring high concurrency and minimal latency:

- **High Concurrency**: Handles thousands of simultaneous connections for reconnaissance or fuzzing.
- **Minimal Latency**: Maintains quick response times even under heavy load.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Adjusts dynamically based on hardware capabilities.

### Benchmark Results:

| Configuration      | Average Latency |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Single Port         | ~100ms          |
| 1000 Ports          | ~115ms          |
| 65,000 Ports        | ~500ms          |

## 🔧 Bug Bounty-Specific Features

- **Traffic Analysis**: Logs and inspects incoming and outgoing traffic for vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted data or weak authentication.
- **Fuzzing and Stress Testing**: Generate high volumes of malformed or edge-case requests to uncover vulnerabilities.
- **Dynamic Port Monitoring**: Easily adjust port ranges during testing for greater flexibility.
- **Custom Payload Support**: Inject and analyze custom payloads for penetration testing.

## 🧪 Testing

Ensure stability and functionality with the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Security-Specific Testing:
- **Network Tests**: Validate multi-port listening and concurrent connection handling.
- **System Tests**: Simulate high-concurrency scenarios to test system robustness.

## 🛠️ Example Use Cases

1. **Port Reconnaissance**:
   - Identify open ports and active services during the reconnaissance phase of bug bounty engagements.

2. **Traffic Interception**:
   - Capture, inspect, and modify traffic to identify vulnerabilities, such as insecure protocols or misconfigured services.

3. **Fuzzing and Stress Testing**:
   - Simulate high-traffic loads or send malformed requests to test the target system’s resilience.

4. **Custom Payload Delivery**:
   - Deliver crafted payloads for testing specific vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.
